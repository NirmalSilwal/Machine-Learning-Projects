"""Collaging Film"" is a series of shorts dating back to 2007. Published NY artist and writer, Stephen Mead, started out fairly bare-bones when beginning to make films, an experimentation which he considered a sort of folk art. Eventually Stephen transitioned from the use of subtitles in his work to creating his own mp3s for soundtracks and effects, finally interweaving actual footage amid paintings and digitized images in hopes of creating a more engaging experience for the viewer. As a Folk Artist, mainly using Windows Movie Maker, a program on many-a-computer, Stephen enjoys the fact that most anyone can use this program to make films of their own. He also likes knowing that these films are ""low-tech Independents"", not subject to Studio Backing (!) and meant to be viewed on the small screens of televisions or computer monitors. Stephen feels this creates for a more intimate viewing experience that is perfect for the variety of themes found in his work. This second disc of Stephen Mead's shorts includes his music videos for the CD song cycle, ""Whispers of Arias, Volumes 1 and 2"". These include ""Rings"", a remembrance piece for 911, and ""Patroclus"", a homage to same-sex love. To round out the collection is ""Our Collage Life"" created for the ""It Gets Better"" project.",Collaging Film,2718,N/A,87,Animation,tt4416372,2012,English

Before understanding this painful inner circle, he must step back to the outer circle where his sins began: the death of his girlfriend, Sarah (Sarah Taurchini) and subsequently the death of himself.

Betty has spent her entire adult life building her defenses, only to have them systematically worn down by the neighboring nursing home philanderer, Johnny Pinkley, - an aging charmer and hopeless romantic determined to win back Betty's love after breaking her heart decades earlier by going off to the Korean War. Meanwhile, Amber stumbles onto a romantic dilemma of her own: Jason a dashing but troubled younger man, whose path has fatefully crossed hers. Amber is determined to transfer her sense of hope and wonder to Jason before it's too late. At first suspicious and confused by Amber's impermeable happiness, Jason grows enchanted by this beautiful, older woman who, despite tremendous heartache, seems to have the secret to life that makes it worth fighting for.

"Greenpoint Tavern tells the story of seven men, all from different walks of life, who share their personal stories and connections to the events of September 11 over the course of one evening at a local bar in Brooklyn. But much more than that it is an intensely dynamic study of the nature and perpetuation human conflict and how we manage to coexist, or perhaps simply survive, in the face of that.

So, while 9/11 serves as centerpiece for the conflict and dialog within the piece, it is ultimately a frame of reference for this particular microcosm of human existence.

"Set against the urban jungle of 1963 New York's gangland subculture, this coming of age teenage movie is set around the Italian gang the Wanderers. Slight comedy, slight High School angst and every bit entertaining with its classic 1950's Rock n' Roll soundtrack such as ""Walk Like a Man"", ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" by The Four Seasons and ""My Boyfriend's Back"" by The Angels. Focusing around a football game where the different gangs play with and against each other, then at its grand finale, come together in a mass of union to defend their honour and their turf. Nostalgic stuff and above all a Rock n' Roll retrospective on a grand musical era.

"Low Movie (How To Quit Smoking) follows the entire career of the iconic band Low and their relationship with director Philip Harder. For twenty years they made music videos and short films together, filming on ice, in railroad yards, and in rapidly disintegrating rooms. Low formed in 1993. Before the band's debut record, Harder, armed with a 16mm camera, filmed the band on Lake Superior in minus 30 wind-chill. At the time Low bucked rock protocol by turning their volume down and the haunting visuals helped define their minimalist approach. As Low matured they turned up and the lyrics grew more aggressive and political. The visuals followed suit resulting in clips that were never released due to the violent subject matter. Year after year, for two decades, Harder continued to shoot Low's music. For Low Movie, Harder went back into the vaults and reassembled all of his 16mm negatives, including outtakes, new material mixed with old, much of which has never been seen by anyone, including the band.

"SMS Emden was the second and final member of the Dresden class of light cruisers built for the Imperial German Navy (Kaiserliche Marine). She was launched in May 1908, and completed in July 1909. Emden was armed with ten 10.5 cm (4.1 in) guns and two torpedo tubes. Emden spent the majority of her career overseas in the German East Asia Squadron, based in Tsingtao, China. In 1913, she came under the command of Karl von Müller, who would captain the ship during her career in World War I. At the outbreak of hostilities, Emden captured a Russian steamer and converted her into the commerce raider Cormoran. Emden rejoined the East Asia Squadron, after which she was detached for independent raiding in the Indian Ocean. The cruiser spent nearly two months operating in the region, and captured nearly two dozen ships. Müller took Emden to raid the Cocos Islands, where he landed a contingent of sailors to destroy British facilities. There, Emden was attacked by the Australian cruiser HMAS Sydney. The more powerful Australian ship quickly inflicted serious damage and forced Müller to run his ship aground to prevent her from sinking. Out of a crew of 376, 133 were killed in the battle.

"Saint Janet is a quirky drama about a family that struggles with what to do when the mother, Janet, becomes convinced that she's spoken to God. Janet believes she's been given the power to heal through her touch, and she's determined to devote everything she has -- including all of her money - - to this pursuit. At the heart of the film is a provocative question: what if someone close to you started believing something utterly outlandish, yet believing it made them happier than they'd ever been? Janet's grown children are faced with this question, and they wrestle with how to react. The film draws inspiration from a fascinating American phenomenon: the surprising number of purported faith healers. Faith healers have gone mainstream, even appearing on Dr. Oz and Oprah's talk shows. A 2001 Gallup poll found that 54% of adult Americans of all religions believed in spiritual healing. The psychology of this makes a lot of sense: when faced with the uncertainty of illness, it's natural to hope for the certainty of a miracle. Saint Janet explores this psychological truth, and examines the role that belief has in all of our lives. It explores family and forgiveness, community and charity, and ultimately asks the question: how do you know what's the right way to live your life?",Saint Janet,2718,N/A,87,"Drama, Family",tt3020754,2014,English

"November 1985, and the troubled streets of Belfast are torn up by rioting yet again. In amongst the angry mob, we find nine year old Tommy, nonchalantly dribbling a ball through the insanity. Whilst politicians argue over the peace process, there's only one thing on young Tommy's football-mad mind - the forthcoming World Cup, where tiny Northern Ireland will take on the mighty Brazil. For the South American giants it's just another step on the path to inevitable global domination, yet for Northern Ireland, and young Tommy, it's the biggest game of their lives. They are two countries that couldn't seem further apart: Northern Ireland, with its Orange men and Republican kerbstones, the Rev'd Ian Paisley and Fergal Sharkey; and Brazil with its carnival, its Samba, with Pelé and the 'beautiful game'. On the football field, eccentric Northern Ireland coach Billy Bingham (they call him Mr FIFA - ""a fee for this and a fee for that"") must plug together a bunch of misfits and third divisioners. Brazil are led by none other than the philosopher-captain (Dr.) Sócrates, who has, in part, inspired the collapse of his country's ruthless military junta, and they are the hot favourites to scoop up football's ultimate prize. As bunting replaces bombs on the streets of Belfast, and Catholic and Protestants alike turn their attention to the big match, Tommy's dockworker turned philosopher father Arthur uses his son's passion for football to enlighten him on the events that make up his chaotic world. The story interweaves young Tommy's coming of age tale with the trials and travails of the hapless Northern Irish team over the nine months leading up to their ultimate game, in the stifling heat of Mexico at the world's greatest festival of football. As the hours tick down to the ultimate battle, with his lead striker crocked, Bingham is forced to place his faith in young rookie, Davey Campbell - ""the next George Best"". Back home, Tommy waits anxiously for the biggest day of his life - because the day of the match is also his tenth birthday - and his father has promised to take him to the ""top of the World"" - the massive crane at Belfast Docks where Arthur works. From here he can see the whole of his world, but can he understand the lessons his father, inspired by the Greek philosopher Socrates, is trying to teach him? This is a story of two nations, two teams, and a father and a son, the things that divide them and the things that unite us all. Set against the backdrop of the 1986 World Cup and the socio-political backgrounds of both nations - this is the story of the world's smallest footballing nation, taking on its best. With laughter and passion, this is the ultimate story of the beautiful game and what it means.",Shooting for Socrates,2592,N/A,72,"Comedy, Drama, Sport",tt3223394,2014,English

Prem promises Sunder a handsomely paying teacher's job in Dubai that would give Sunder enough money to start his school within two years. Sunder does as told and arrives in Bombay to meet Prem; not only is there no sign of his friend at the station, but Sunder also gets unwittingly involved with a petty thief who robs him of all his luggage and money. To make matters worse, when Sunder reaches Prem's lodge, he finds an apologetic letter from Prem informing him that he has used his Rs.10,000 to get himself to Dubai instead and will one day repay him. Now at the end of his tether, Sunder wanders into an old Christian cemetery. Sitting on an old grave, Sunder gives vent to his frustrations and strikes the tombstone in helplessness, but immediately apologizes to the deceased. This amuses the ghost of Amar Kumar-- alias Marco (Naseeruddin Shah)-- who was killed and thrown into the grave 20 years before, only to rise at Sunder's apology. Marco explains to a frightened Sunder that he was a notorious Crime Don, who at the behest of his romantic partner Savitri (Malvika Tiwari), had resolved to give up crime, but was shot by his protÃ©gÃ© Kunta the day after the wedding. Marco seeks Sunder's help in getting even with his killers and promises Sunder a job and a place to stay in return. Marco manages to get Sunder a post in a school run by his father-in-law (Shammi Kapoor). Everyone grows fond of the new games teacher, including Marco's daughter (Urmila Matondkar). This last, a vivacious girl of an age with Sunder, courts the boy at least twice, accompanied by her largely invisible father. Kunta (Tinnu Anand) makes an attempt to capture the playing ground on the college campus. The college is starved of funds and proposes a cricket match to collect funds. Sunder and his team are helped by the invisible Marco, who cheats on their behalf and ensures victory. When Sunder tries to tell the others that he can see and talk to Marco, nobody believes him.

So the pardesi comes to India with his ""American"" son Rajiv to find a suitable '""Indian"" girl for him. Kishorilal hopes his soon-to-be bahu will instill some Indian values in his extremely westernized beta.

"Bhagat was born in British India during the year 1908. As a child he witnessed numerous atrocities committed on fellow Indians by their British rulers, who came to trade under the guise of the East India Company, but ended up controlling most of the nation, and permitting tyrants such as General Dyer to massacre thousands of innocent men, women and children in Jallianwala Baug. As a child he was impressed by Mohandas K. Gandhi, especially his call to launch the non-cooperation movement, which led to thousands of people burning British-made clothing, giving up schools, & college studies, and government jobs - only to be let down by Gandhi himself when he called off the movement. Undaunted, Bhagat decided to be a revolutionary, starting with getting into petty fights, then as a grown-up joining the Hindustan Republic Association. When Lala Lajpat Rai was beaten to death by the police, Bhagat, along with Shivram Rajguru, Sukhdev, and others daringly carried out the assassination of a police officer named Saunders, which eventually led to Bhagat's arrest, where he was lodged in a cell, tortured and beaten mercilessly. His father, Kishan, paid Rs.60,000/- and bailed him out, so that he could get him to run a diary-farm and get married to a girl from Manavali. But being a revolutionary was in Bhagat's blood, and when the British proposed the Trade Disputes and Public Safety Bills, he would initiate the bombing in the Indian Parliament Building, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, be arrested, and tried in an open court. This is where Bhagat launched his much-publicized revolution, and became popular with the masses, especially the younger generation, laborers, and farmers, so much so that his popularity rivaled that of Gandhi himself. Even in prison, Bhagat made headline news when he and other prisoners undertook a 63 day fast unto death to improve the conditions of Indian freedom-fighter prisoners. Then the British re-opened the Saunders' murder case, which led to death sentences being imposed on Bhagat, Shivram, and Sukhdev. The entire nation rose up in protest, including the Congress party - with the ball being in Gandhi's court - for he was due to sign the Irwing Pact, and Indians hoped that he would use this as a bargaining chip to save the lives of the heroic trio. Will Gandhi rise up to the occasion and save the trio - so that they could pave the way for a modern and independent India, not just a country ruled by the British with a dominant status - an India free of communal hatred, injustice, corruption, and fundamentalism, or will Gandhi end up disappointing Bhagat all over again?",The Legend of Bhagat Singh,5510,http://i.media-imdb.com/images/SF1f0a42ee1aa08d477a576fbbf7562eed/realm/feature.gif,8.1,"Biography, Drama, History",tt0319736,2002,Hindi
